## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
As a Hypixel sweat, I would like to track the statistics of Hypixel players on-the-go. Realizing the lack of a [plancke-like](https://plancke.io/) statistics tracker in the App store, I wanted to fill in the gap and create a Statistics tracker for Hypixel.

P.S, this app also serves as an exercise for learning React Native. Contributors are welcome!

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
<!-- See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites
You will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or higher. [Yarn classic (v1)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) is recommended to install the project's dependency.

You might also need to follow [React Native's development environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions to setup Android / iOS development environment. In this project, we are using the React Native CLI, without Expo. The author of the project mainly uses Arch Linux (btw.) for development.

### Installing
You will need to clone the repo to your machine

```sh
git clone https://github.com/angeloanan/hypixstats
cd hypixstats
```

Install the dependencies

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

You will need to create a `.env` file or edit the system environment variable
Example environment variable is available on `.env.example`

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
